## NLP_Team_13: Tokenizer Training and Model Training

---

### Overview
This project focuses on two main tasks: training tokenizers and fine-tuning a language model for NLP performance.

- **Task 1: Training Tokenizers**
  - Trained six different tokenizers on a 10k dataset.
  - Evaluated each tokenizer's performance using fertility scores.
  - Selected the best-performing tokenizer based on fertility score results.

- **Task 2: Fine-Tuning Language Model**
  - Adjusted the LLaMA model architecture to stay within a 100M parameter limit.
  - Used the top-performing tokenizer from Task 1 to tokenize the dataset.
  - Recorded perplexity scores at every 0.1 epoch.
  - Created a matrix of perplexity scores for each epoch.
  - Tested the fine-tuned model on 10 prompts to evaluate맗erformance.

### Project Tasks

### Task 1.1: Tokenizer Training
We trained six different tokenizers on samples from a previously scraped dataset to evaluate performance based on fertility scores:

- **Tokenizer Fertility Scores**: See [NLP-Assignment-2_Tokenizer_Training.pdf](https://github.com/vaishnavkoka/NLP_Assignment_2/blob/main/Results/NLP-%20Assignment-2_Tokenizer_Training.pdf).

Each tokenizer was evaluated on fertility, and a matrix showing fertility scores and dataset size was generated. This matrix, available in [NLP-Assignment-2_Tokenizer_Training.pdf](https://github.com/vaishnavkoka/NLP_Assignment_2/blob/main/Results/NLP-%20Assignment-2_Tokenizer_Training.pdf), showed that **SentencePieceBPETokenizer** had the lowest fertility score and was selected as the optimal tokenizer for Task 2.

### Task 2.1: Model Training

---
#### LLaMA Model Training and Evaluation
This project involves training a modified LLaMA model with fewer than 100M parameters for efficient training and evaluation. The model is tokenized using SentencePieceBPETokenizer.

- Tokenized dataset using SentencePieceBPETokenizer.
- Trained the model and logged *perplexity scores* at every 0.1 epoch.
- Generated a matrix of perplexity scores by epoch for analysis.
- Tested the model on 10 sample prompts.
- *Output screenshots* showcasing the model's performance are included in the repository.
