## NLP_Team_13: Tokenizer Training and Model Training

---

### Overview
This project focuses on two main tasks: training tokenizers and fine-tuning a language model for NLP performance.

- **Task 1: Training Tokenizers**
  - Trained six different tokenizers on a 10k dataset.
  - Evaluated each tokenizer's performance using fertility scores.
  - Selected the best-performing tokenizer based on fertility score results.

- **Task 2: Fine-Tuning Language Model**
  - Adjusted the LLaMA model architecture to stay within a 100M parameter limit.
  - Used the top-performing tokenizer from Task 1 to tokenize the dataset.
  - Recorded perplexity scores at every 0.1 epoch.
  - Created a matrix of perplexity scores for each epoch.
  - Tested the fine-tuned model on 10 prompts to evaluate맗erformance.

### Project Tasks

#### Task 1: Tokenizer Training
We trained six different tokenizers on samples from a previously scraped dataset to evaluate performance based on fertility scores:

- **Tokenizer Fertility Scores**: See [NLP-Assignment-2_Tokenizer_Training.pdf](https://github.com/vaishnavkoka/NLP_Assignment_2/blob/main/Results/NLP-%20Assignment-2_Tokenizer_Training.pdf).

Each tokenizer was evaluated on fertility, and a matrix showing fertility scores and dataset size was generated. This matrix, available in [NLP-Assignment-2_Tokenizer_Training.pdf](https://github.com/vaishnavkoka/NLP_Assignment_2/blob/main/Results/NLP-%20Assignment-2_Tokenizer_Training.pdf), showed that **SentencePieceBPETokenizer** had the lowest fertility score and was selected as the optimal tokenizer for Task 2.

---

#### Task 2.1: Model Training

---
The **LLaMA** model architecture was adjusted to ensure fewer than 100M parameters for efficient training. Using the SentencePieceBPETokenizer, we tokenized our dataset and trained the model, logging perplexity scores at each 0.1 epoch. A matrix of perplexity scores by epoch was generated and added to the repository. Additionally, the model was tested on 10 sample prompts, with test outputs available in the repository screenshots.

## Usage

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Run `requirements.txt` to set up the environment for tokenizer and model training.

2. **Run Tasks Sequentially**  
   - **Task 1**: Execute the tokenizer training scripts and save fertility scores to the output matrix.
   - **Task 2**: Configure and fine-tune the LLaMA model with the selected tokenizer, logging perplexity scores.

3. **Access Output Files**  
   All relevant matrices, screenshots, and test outputs are available in the project repository for review.
