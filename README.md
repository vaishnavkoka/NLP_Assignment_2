# NLP_Team_13: Tokenizer Training and Model Training

---

## Overview
This project addresses two main tasks: training six different tokenizers on a 10k dataset to evaluate fertility scores and fine-tuning a language model for optimized NLP performance. For Task 1, we trained six tokenizers and selected the best-performing one based on fertility scores. In Task 2, the LLaMA model architecture was adjusted to stay under 100M parameters, using the top-performing tokenizer to tokenize the dataset. Perplexity scores were recorded at every 0.1 epoch, and a matrix of scores for each epoch was created. The model was also tested on 10 prompts to evaluate its performance.

## Project Tasks

---

### Task 1: Tokenizer Training
We trained six different tokenizers on samples from a previously scraped dataset to evaluate performance based on fertility scores:
1. **BertWordPieceTokenizer**
2. **SentencePieceBPETokenizer**
3. **gpt2byteleveltokenizer**
4. **ByteLevelBPETokenizer**
5. **SentencePieceUnigramTokenizer**
6. **SpaCyTokenizer**

### Task 1: Tokenizer Training
We trained six different tokenizers on samples from a previously scraped dataset to evaluate performance based on fertility scores:

| **SpaCyTokenizer**                | [游릴 Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vaishnavkoka24310069/spacytokenizer/) |



Each tokenizer was evaluated on fertility, and a matrix showing fertility scores and dataset size was generated. This matrix, available in [NLP-Assignment-2_Tokenizer_Training.pdf](https://github.com/vaishnavkoka/NLP_Assignment_2/blob/main/NLP-%20Assignment-2_Tokenizer_Training.pdf), showed that **SentencePieceBPETokenizer** had the lowest fertility score and was selected as the optimal tokenizer for Task 2.

---

### Task 2: Model Training

---
The **LLaMA** model architecture was adjusted to ensure fewer than 100M parameters for efficient training. Using the SentencePieceBPETokenizer, we tokenized our dataset and trained the model, logging perplexity scores at each 0.1 epoch. A matrix of perplexity scores by epoch was generated and added to the repository. Additionally, the model was tested on 10 sample prompts, with test outputs available in the repository screenshots.
